# [](#introduction)Introduction

Laranotify is the most advanced and recommended laravel package that redefines the way alert messages or notifications are displayed on screen. This is built with fluency in mind--meaning, you can chain as many methods as you want.

It's built on top of Bootstrap notify or growl plugin. Every method found there in is included in the package. It therefore, requires you to have bootstrap installed on your project. However, customizing the template, gives your users different looks. Read about template customization under templates section.

> **Note:** To start building your custom template, itâ€™s advisable to publish a sample to your view directory. When published, the sample template will be copied to laranotify directory inside your views folder.
